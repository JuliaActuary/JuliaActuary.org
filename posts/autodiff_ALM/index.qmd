Asset liability modeling requires computing derivatives of portfolio values with respect to yield curve changes. Traditional approaches use finite difference methods or analytical approximations, but automatic differentiation ("autodiff" or "AD") provides exact derivatives with minimal additional computation. This post demonstrates how to implement ALM workflows using autodiff in Julia.

```{julia}
using FinanceCore              # provides Cashflow object
using DifferentiationInterface # autodiff 
import ForwardDiff             # specific autodiff technique
using CairoMakie               # plotting
using DataInterpolations       # yield curve interpolation
using Transducers              # data aggregation
using JuMP, HiGHS              # portfolio optimization
using LinearAlgebra            # math
using BenchmarkTools           # benchmarking
using OhMyThreads              # multi-threading
```

## Interest Rate Curve Setup

We start by constructing a yield curve using cubic spline interpolation:

The `curve` function creates a discount factor curve from zero rates and time points. This curve will serve as input to our `value` function, which makes it straightforward to compute sensitivities by differentiating with respect to the rate parameters.

```{julia}

zeros = [0.01, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.055] #continuous

times = [1., 2., 3., 5., 10., 20.]

function curve(zeros, times)
    DataInterpolations.CubicSpline([1.0; exp.(-zeros .* times)], [0.; times])
end

c = curve(zeros, times)
```

## Asset Valuation Framework

The core valuation function operates on any instrument that produces cashflows:

```{julia}
function value(curve, asset)
    cfs = asset(curve)
    mapreduce(cf -> cf.amount * curve(cf.time), +, cfs)
end
```

This design separates the valuation logic from the instrument definition. Each asset type implements a callable interface that generates cashflows given a yield curve. Note how the asset itself gets passed the curve (the `asset(curve)` statement) to determine the cashflows.

For fixed bonds, we create a structure that generates periodic coupon payments:

```{julia}
#| output: false
struct FixedBond{A,B,C}
    coupon::A
    tenor::B
    periodicity::C
end
function (b::FixedBond)(curve)
    map(1//b.periodicity:1//b.periodicity:b.tenor) do t
        Cashflow(b.coupon / b.periodicity + (t == b.tenor ? 1. : 0.), t)
    end
end

function par_yield(curve, tenor, periodicity)
    dfs = curve.(1//periodicity:1//periodicity:tenor)

    (1 - last(dfs)) / sum(dfs) * periodicity
end
```

The `(b::FixedBond)(curve)` function (sometimes called a 'functor', since we are using the `b` object itself as the function invocation) takes the curve and returns an array of `Cashflow`s. 

:::callout-note
`Cashflow` objects are part of the [JuliaActuary suite](https://juliaactuary.org/packages). This allows the cashflows to be tied with the exact timepoint that they occur, rather than needing a bunch of logic to pre-determine a timestep (annual, quarterly, etc.) for which cashflows would get bucketed. This is more efficient in many cases and much simpler code.
:::

The `par_yield` function computes the coupon rate that prices the bond at par, which we'll use to construct our asset universe.

Here's an example of bond cashflows and valuing that bond using the curve `c` that we constructed earlier.

```{julia}
FixedBond(0.08, 10, 2)(c)
```

```{julia}
value(c, FixedBond(0.09, 10, 2))
```

## Liability Modeling

Deferred annuities require more complex modeling than fixed bonds due to policyholder behavior (optionality). The surrender rate depends on the difference between market rates and the guaranteed rate. The surrender function chosen below is arbitrary, but follows a typical pattern with much higher surrenders if the market rate on competing instruments is higher than what's currently available. The account value accumulates at the guaranteed rate, and surrenders create negative cashflows representing benefit payments. Lastly, the `annuities` function is a wrapper function we will use to compute the portfolio value and ALM metrics later.

```{julia}
begin
    struct DeferredAnnuity{A,B}
        tenor::A
        rate::B
    end

    function (d::DeferredAnnuity)(curve)
        av = 1.
        map(1//12:1//12:d.tenor) do t
            mkt_rate = -log(curve(d.tenor) / curve(t)) / (d.tenor - t)
            av *= exp(d.rate / 12)
            rate_diff = mkt_rate - d.rate
            sr = t == d.tenor ? 1.0 : surrender_rate(rate_diff) / 12
            av_surr = av * sr
            av -= av_surr
            Cashflow(-av_surr, t)

        end
    end
    function surrender_rate(rate_diff)
        1 / (1 + exp(3 - rate_diff * 60))
    end
    function annuities(rates, portfolio)
        times = [1., 2., 3., 5., 10., 20.]

        c = curve(rates, times)

        # threaded map-reduce for more speed
        OhMyThreads.tmapreduce(+, 1:length(portfolio); ntasks=Threads.nthreads()) do i
                value(c,portfolio[i])
        end
    end

end
```

Here's what the surrender rate behavior looks like for different levels of market rates compared to the a 3% crediting rate.

```{julia}
let
    cred_rate = 0.03
    mkt_rates = 0.005:0.001:0.08
    rate_diff = mkt_rates .- cred_rate

    lines(rate_diff,surrender_rate.(rate_diff),
    axis=(
        title="Surrender rate by difference to market rate",
        xlabel="Rate Difference",
        ylabel="Annual Surrender Rate"
    ))
end

```


We model a large portfolio of these annuities with random tenors:

```{julia}
liabilities = map(1:100_000) do i
    tenor = rand(1:20)
    DeferredAnnuity(tenor, par_yield(c,tenor,12)) 
end
```

## Consolidating Cashflows

Later on we will generate vectors of vectors of cashflows without any guarantee that the timepoints will line up, making aggregating cashflows by timepoitns a non-obvious task. There are many ways to accomplish this, but [I like Transducers](https://juliaactuary.github.io/FinanceModels.jl/dev/faq/#Why-does-the-package-rely-on-using-Transducers?). 

Transducers are unfamiliar to many people, and don't let the presence deter you from the main points of this post. The details aren't central to the point of this blog post so just skip over if confusing.

```{julia}
function consolidate(cashflows)

    cashflows |> # take the collection
    MapCat(identity) |> # flatten it out without changing elements
    # group by the time, and just keep and sum the amounts 
    GroupBy(x -> x.time, Map(last) ⨟ Map(x -> x.amount), +) |>
    foldxl(Transducers.right) # perform the aggregation and keep the final grouped result
end
```

Example:

```{julia}
cashflow_vectors = [l(c) for l in liabilities]
```

And running `consolidate` groups the cashflows into `timepoint => amount` pairs.

```{julia}
consolidate(cashflow_vectors)
```
:::

Here's a visualization of the liability cashflows, showing that when the interest rates are bumped up slightly, that there is more surrenders that occur earlier on (so there's fewer policies around at the time of each maturity). Negative cashflows are outflows:


```{julia}
let
    d = consolidate([p(c) for p in liabilities])
    ks = collect(keys(d)) |> sort!
    vs = [d[k] for k in ks]

    c2 = curve(zeros .+ 0.005, times)
    d2 = consolidate([p(c2) for p in liabilities])
    ks2 = collect(keys(d2)) |> sort!
    vs2 = [d2[k] for k in ks2]

    f = Figure(size = (900, 600))
    ax = Axis(f[1, 1], 
        xlabel = "Time (Years)",
        ylabel = "Cashflow Amount",
        title = "Liability Cashflows: Base vs +50bp Rate Shock",
    )

    scatter!(ax, ks, vs, label = "Base Scenario")

    scatter!(ax, ks2, vs2, label = "+50bp Rate Shock")

    axislegend(ax, position = :rb)

    f
end

```

In the upwards shaped yield curve, without a surrender charge or market value adjustment, many mid-to-late-duration policyholders elect to surrender instead of hold to maturity.

## Computing Derivatives with Autodiff

Rather than approximating derivatives through finite differences, autodiff computes exact values, gradients, and Hessians:

The `value_gradient_and_hessian` function returns the present value, key rate durations (gradient), and convexities (Hessian diagonal) for the entire liability portfolio. We compute similar derivatives for each potential asset.

```{julia}
vgh_liab = let
    value_gradient_and_hessian(z -> annuities(z, liabilities), AutoForwardDiff(), zeros)
end
```

### Gradients and Hessians in ALM

Let's dive into the results here a little bit.

The first element of `vgh_liab` is the value of the liability portfolio using the yield curve constructed earlier:

```{julia}
vgh_liab[1]
```

The second element of `vgh_liab` is the partial derivative with respect to each of the inputs (here, just the `zeros` rates that dictate the curve). The sum of the partials is the effective duration of the liabilities. 

```{julia}
@show sum(vgh_liab[2])
vgh_liab[2]
```

This is the sensitivity relative to a full unit change in rates (e.g. `1.0`). So if we wanted to estimate the dollar impact of a 50bps change, we would take `0.005` times the gradient/hessian. Also note these are 'dollar durations' but we could divide by the price to get `effective` or percentage durations:

```{julia}
-sum(vgh_liab[2]) / vgh_liab[1]
```


Additionally, note that this is the dynamic duration of the liabilities, not the static duration which ignores the effect of the interest-sensitive behavior of the liabilities.

```{julia}
let 
    dynamic(zeros) = value(curve(zeros,times),liabilities[1])
    cfs = liabilities[1](c)
    static(zeros) = let
        c = curve(zeros,times)
        # note that `cfs` are defined outside of the function, so 
        # will not change as the curve is sensitized
        mapreduce(cf -> c(cf.time) * cf.amount,+,cfs)
    end

    @show gradient(dynamic,AutoForwardDiff(),zeros) |> sum
    @show gradient(static,AutoForwardDiff(),zeros) |> sum
end
```

Due to the steepness of the surrender function, the policy exiting sooner, on average, results in a higher change in value than if the policy was not sensitive to the change in rates. The increase in value from earlier cashflows outweighs the greater discount rate.

The third element of `vgh_liab` is the Hessian matrix, containing all second partial derivatives with respect to the yield curve inputs:

```{julia}
vgh_liab[3]
```

This matrix captures the convexity characteristics of the liability portfolio. The diagonal elements represent "key rate convexities"—how much the duration at each key rate changes as that specific rate moves:

```{julia}
@show diag(vgh_liab[3])
@show sum(diag(vgh_liab[3]))  # Total dollar convexity
```

Like duration, we can convert dollar convexity to percentage convexity by dividing by the portfolio value:

```{julia}
sum(diag(vgh_liab[3])) / vgh_liab[1]
```

The off-diagonal elements show cross-convexities—how the sensitivity to one key rate changes when a different key rate moves. For most portfolios, these cross-terms are smaller than the diagonal terms but can be significant for complex instruments.

This convexity measurement is also dynamic, capturing how the surrender behavior changes the second-order interest rate sensitivity:

```{julia}
let 
    dynamic(zeros) = value(curve(zeros,times),liabilities[1])
    cfs = liabilities[1](c)
    static(zeros) = let
        c = curve(zeros,times)
        mapreduce(cf -> c(cf.time) * cf.amount,+,cfs)
    end

    @show hessian(dynamic,AutoForwardDiff(),zeros) |> diag |> sum
    @show hessian(static,AutoForwardDiff(),zeros) |> diag |> sum
end
```

The dynamic convexity differs from static convexity because the surrender function creates path-dependent behavior. As rates change, not only do the discount factors change, but the timing and magnitude of cashflows shift as well. This interaction between discount rate changes and cashflow timing changes produces the additional convexity captured in the dynamic measurement. Note how the convexity is larger in the dynamic case.

For ALM purposes, this convexity information helps quantify how well a duration-matched hedge will perform under large rate movements.


## Optimizing an Asset Portfolio

### Define Asset Universe

We will create a set of par bonds and select a portfolio of assets that matches the liabilities, subject to duration and KRD constraints:


```{julia}
asset_universe = [
	FixedBond(par_yield(c,t,4),t,4)
	for t in 1:20
]
```

And we capture the measures for each of the available assets for the portfolio selection:

```{julia}
vgh_assets= [value_gradient_and_hessian(x->value(curve(x,times),a),AutoForwardDiff(), zeros) for a in asset_universe]

```


### Optimization Routine

This optimization function uses functionality from [JuMP](https://jump.dev), a robust optimization library in Julia.

With derivatives available, we can optimize the asset portfolio to match liability characteristics.The optimization maximizes asset yield while constraining the difference between asset and liability key rate durations. This ensures that small yield curve movements don't create large changes in surplus.

```{julia}
function optimize_portfolio(assets, vgh_assets, liabs, vgh_liabs, constraints)
    n = length(assets)

    # Create model
    model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
    set_silent(model)  # Suppress solver output

    # Decision variables: weight vector w
    @variable(model, w[1:n])

    @constraint(model, w .>= 0)  # Long-only constraint
    # Budget/asset value constraint
    budget_sum = sum(w .* [a[1] for a in vgh_assets]) + vgh_liabs[1]
    @constraint(model, budget_sum <= 1e2)
    @constraint(model, budget_sum >= -1e2)

    # Objective: Maximize total yield
    @objective(model, Max, sum(w[i] * assets[i].coupon for i in 1:n))

    # Gradient component (krd) constraints
    for j in 1:length(vgh_liabs[2])
        gradient_sum = sum(w[i] * vgh_assets[i][2][j] for i in 1:n) - sum(vgh_liabs[2][j])

        @constraint(model, gradient_sum >= constraints[:krd][:lower])
        @constraint(model, gradient_sum <= constraints[:krd][:upper])
    end

    # total duration constraint 
    duration_gap = sum(w[i] * sum(vgh_assets[i][2]) for i in 1:n) + sum(vgh_liabs[2])
    @constraint(model, duration_gap <= constraints[:krd][:upper])
    @constraint(model, duration_gap >= constraints[:krd][:lower])

    # Solve
    optimize!(model)

    # Return results
    if termination_status(model) == MOI.OPTIMAL
        return (
            status=:optimal,
            weights=JuMP.value.(w),
            objective_value=objective_value(model),
        )
    else
        return (status=termination_status(model), weights=nothing)
    end
end


# Define gradient constraints
constraints = Dict(
    :krd => Dict(:lower => -0.5e6, :upper => 0.5e6),
    :duration => Dict(:lower => -0.05e6, :upper => 0.15e6)
)

# Optimize
result = optimize_portfolio(asset_universe, vgh_assets, liabilities, vgh_liab, constraints)

```

### Results

The optimization produces asset weights that hedge the liability portfolio. We can visualize both the resulting cashflow patterns and the key rate duration matching:

```{julia}
let

    asset_cfs = map(1:length(asset_universe)) do i
        cfs =
            result.weights[i] * asset_universe[i](c)
    end

    d = consolidate(asset_cfs)
    ks = collect(keys(d)) |> sort!
    vs = [d[k] for k in ks]
    scatter(ks, vs,
        axis = (
            title="Asset Cashflows",
            xlabel="Time (years)",
            ylabel="Cashflow Amount"
        )
    )

end

```



```{julia}

let
    asset_krds = sum(getindex.(vgh_assets,2) .* result.weights)
    liab_krds = -vgh_liab[2]

    f = Figure(size = (800, 500))
    ax = Axis(f[1, 1], 
        xlabel = "Tenor (Years)",
        ylabel = "Key Rate Dollar Duration",
        title = "Asset vs Liability Key Rate Dollar Duration Profile",
    )
    
    scatter!(ax, times, asset_krds, label = "Optimized Assets")
    
    scatter!(ax, times, liab_krds, label = "Liabilities")
    
    axislegend(ax, position = :rt)
    
    
    f
end

```

The first plot shows the distribution of asset cashflows over time. The second compares the key rate duration profiles of the optimized asset portfolio and the liability portfolio, demonstrating how well the hedge performs across different points on the yield curve.


## Computational Benefits

Autodiff provides several advantages over traditional finite difference approaches:

- Exact derivatives rather than approximations
- Single function evaluation computes value and all derivatives
- No tuning of step sizes or dealing with numerical artifacts
- Scales efficiently to high-dimensional parameter spaces

For ALM applications, this means more accurate risk measurement and the ability to optimize portfolios with complex constraints that would be computationally expensive using traditional methods.

Here, we value 100,000 interest-sensitive policies with a monthly timestep for up to 20 years *and* compute 1st and 2nd order partial sensitives extremely quickly:

```{julia}
@btime value_gradient_and_hessian(z -> annuities(z, liabilities), AutoForwardDiff(), zeros)
```
