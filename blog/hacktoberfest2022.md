## What is Hacktoberfest?

> Hacktoberfest is DigitalOceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October.

By contributing to open source, you can get a t-shirt (or a tree planted!) upon submitting four contributions to open source projects. See the [Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.com/) for more details.

## JuliaActuary participiation

JuliaActuary has a number of "issues" with the `hacktoberfest` tag on Github across all the repositories which identify "easier" or introductory contribution ideas. See this [project board](https://github.com/orgs/JuliaActuary/projects/3) for items with the hacktoberfest tag or browse indivual packages' issues page.

If you particpate and submit at least two of your contributions to JuliaActuary, we will mail you a JuliaActuary sticker as thanks!

## Low-code or no-code contributions

We welcome contributions that have low or no-code in them. That could be as simple as new documentation, changing some website CSS, writing a blog post about your experience, etc. Hacktoberfest [has a list](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code) of low/no-code suggestions.

If you have ideas but aren't sure where to begin, start a discussion here: [https://github.com/orgs/JuliaActuary/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/JuliaActuary/discussions).
